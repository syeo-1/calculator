things I learned about:
- using emmet to quickly write html
- familiarizing myself with vscode and chrome devtools for development/debugging
- using css grids to organize sections of html and styles
- familiarizing myself with DOM manipulation
- writing vanilla javascript code
- refactoring code
- developing new features and writing informative commit messages

things to improve on for future projects:
- the use of many boolean flags really slowed down development and should be avoided on this scale in all future projects
- continue using emmet to get used to it for speedy html writing
- use devtools more. development was also slowed due to learning about how to use
- asking for external input/advice
